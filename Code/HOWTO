HOW TO

Description of the different parameters of the algorithm, with default values

a = 1 in [Ã˜-1]      
   #node probability parameter for preferential attachment

m = 1 in [0-1]      
   #global probability parameter for preferential attachment

networkSize = 2000  
   #size of the network to be generated (real size = network size + 2)

alpha = nu1 in [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0] 
   # With probability alpha, "the new community members reacts": one edge is added with the new 
		  node as source. The target is allocated by preferential attachment.

gamma = nu2 in [0.0...nu1] 
   # With probability gamma, "onboarding works": one edge is added with the new node as target
		  and a randomly chosen source.

nb_runs = 2500 
   #number of runs for fitting (random process)

nb_workers = 48
   #number of workers for parallelization
